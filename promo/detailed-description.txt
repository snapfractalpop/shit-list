Add annoying sites to your shit list so you can avoid them later.

Tired of hunting down those pesky auto-play videos? Sick of ad-saturated websites that eat up bandwidth and processing power? What about slide-show sites that won't give you the content you want? Put them on your shit list.

Shit list works by remembering the hostnames of the sites that offend you. Links to your shit-listed sites will have a shit indicator to remind you not to click.

Shit list does not prevent you from visiting sites. It merely serves as an opt-in mild deterrent. If we deny these types of websites our traffic, we can decrease their revenue, and make the web less shitty.

Shit list is open source, so feel free to browse the code at https://github.com/snapfractalpop/shit-list
or fork the project and make a pull request.
